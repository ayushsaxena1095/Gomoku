# Gomoku
This is the repo for our implementation of Gomoku AI.

## Implementation techniques initial thoughts:

There were many approaches for this like using of CNN by training a machine learning model, using minimax with alpha beta pruning.
But eventually the final take was with child selection using MCTS.
To defend against the baseline we used Pattern Recognition and MCTS was used as an attacking approach.
